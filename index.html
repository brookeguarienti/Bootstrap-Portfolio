                <p>
                    I'm Brooke, a Web Development student.
                </p>
                    I went to Illinois State University where I studied in Food and Nutrition Management and Business Administration.
                <p>
                    I began working in the nonprofit industry and was privelaged to work with children with disabilities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   After working in the nonprofit industry for about a year, my husband and I packed up and moved to Nashville. I began working in the Health and Wellness industry as a Digital Assistant, and quickly progressed roles into a Retail Sales Assistant, and then Retail Manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                   As I have enjoyed working in various industries, my interest in Web Development has peaked and I am excited to pursue a career in a challenging, ever-growing field.
